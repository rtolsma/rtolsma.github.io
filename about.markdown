Hi. I'm Ryan Tolsma. I'm 19 years old and am currently a rising senior at Stanford University. I love technical challenges and problem solving, and am particularly
interested in pure mathematics and its applications in physics and machine learning. I enjoy applying the powerful tools of theory towards modelling and solving
real world problems. At Stanford, I perform research in Stanford's Iliad Lab focusing on developing better
algorithms for multi-agent reinforcement learning and dealing with nonstationary environments. In my past, I've worked in quantitative trading
at a propietary trading firm, software engineering at a small startup, and quantitative research in fintech. During my free time, I enjoy playing poker
and board games with friends, reading textbooks, and watching TV.

I have a passion for teaching and decomposing complex concepts into intuitive digestable components. My personal beliefs are that
strong foundations in theory have compounded returns over time and vastly accelerate and simplify the process of learning new fields. 
My current goals primarily center on intensive learning and establishing expertise across a variety of technical fields.


Please feel free to reach out to me via email at rtolsma@stanford.edu if you any questions or inquiries, especially about any of my posts!
